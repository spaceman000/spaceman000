- 🚀 I’m looking to take a part in any of the space connected project it will be extremly interesting for me 
- 👩🏼‍🚀 I’m also want to know many things about the space technology, so I am closely following NASA and ESA as well as other space agencies 
- 📫 How to reach me?: rafmuzica@Gmail.com  ... yeah, I am also sometimes like to record some really crazy and strange music.
If you want to have some new experience with the music and sound - it might be interesting for you to listen to my songs - just find my channel on YouTube.I would like to have some feedback or perhaps even some support - I am open to any offers. currently I am developeding some music as an important process of the Katharsis which I have to go thru to get clean from some terrible feelings I am sometimes experiencing too much. Also I am publishing my music free and also completly anonymously, why? just listen to couple of my songs, and than you will know why! Ha! ha ha...
