- 📫 How to reach me?: rafmuzica@Gmail.com  ... yeah I am sometimes like to record some really crazy and strange music if you want to listen to some new experience with the music and sound it might be interesting for you to listen to my songs, Just find my channel on YouTube for giving me some feedback or perhaps even some support I am open to any offers currently I developeding some music as an important process of the Katharsis which I have to go to get clean from some terrible feelings I am sometimes experiencing too much. Also I am publishing my music anonymously, why? just listen to couple of my songs and than you will know why.
